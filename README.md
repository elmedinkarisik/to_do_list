# to_do_list

To-Do List Web-App made with React and Firebase.

Available at: https://to-do-list-se-project.herokuapp.com/

In this version, v1.0.1, the user is able to add items to his/hers to-do-list. There are 2 preset "items" and the added items are not stored anywhere, so the user gets the same "initial" page on every refresh.
